GAME DESCRIPTION:

We tried to make a common pinball but with an interesting twist; you control two pairs of bumper pads and 
there's two holes where the ball can fall into.
Our pinball theme is based on sweets like chupa-chups and lollipops.
You gain points each time the ball bounces and every 10.000 points, an extra life is added for you to keep playing.
Enjoy!

GAME CONTROLS:

-ARROW DOWN -> spring action to launch the ball and start playing
-LEFT AND RIGHT ARROWS -> control the bumper pads
